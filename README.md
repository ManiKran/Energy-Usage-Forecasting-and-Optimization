# Energy-Usage-Forecasting-and-Optimization
The purpose of this project is to perform comprehensive analysis to understand and predict energy consumption patterns for eSC. Through a blend of sophisticated data analytics and predictive modeling, this project aims to empower eSC with actionable insights that could lead to more efficient energy distribution, improved customer energy management, and the development of robust strategies to handle demand surges, particularly during peak usage times. The goal is to ensure eSC's infrastructure is resilient, responsive, and sustainable in the face of evolving energy demands.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffadd0e8-e200-418b-afc5-9a991f2dc631)
